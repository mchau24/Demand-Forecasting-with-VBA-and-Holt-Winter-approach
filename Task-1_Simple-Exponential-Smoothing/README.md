- Objective: To develop a VBA function that implements simple exponential smoothing to forecast future values based on historical temperature data.

- Data
  - Inputs: Monthly average daily temperatures in the United Kingdom (UK) from January 2015 to December 2022
    - Data source: Stata (https://www.statista.com/statistics/322658/monthly-average-daily-temperatures-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/)
  - Parameters:
    - Timeseries Data: The temperature data over the specified period.
    - Smoothing Parameter: Controls the level of smoothing applied to recent vs. older observations.
    - Initial Level: The starting value for the smoothing process.
  - Output: the forecasted temperature for the next observation in the series, allowing for trend adjustments in temperature forecasting
